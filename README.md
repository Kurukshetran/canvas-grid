# Canvas Grid #

Canvas Grid is what you were looking for if you dont like messing with UI very much. With it you can mess around with your data matrix and let Canvas Grid handle the UI representation of it.

```js
var grid = [
['black', 'grey', 'blue'],
['#f00', '#0f0', '#00f'],
['rgb(0,255,255)', 'rgb(255,0,255)', 'rgb(255,255,0)'],
];
canvasGrid("myCanvas", grid);
```
